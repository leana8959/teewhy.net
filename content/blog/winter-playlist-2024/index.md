Winter has always been my favorite season. Winter has a unique way of blending comforts with introspective moments. The moody skies and crisp air bring both a sense of subdued warmth and sometimes, a touch of melancholy. 
Other than that, the endless festivals and traditions that come with winter also makes it the most meaningful season of my life. 

Here are five songs that I've been repeating obsessively since this November.

## Fortnight - Taylor Swift

> "And for a fortnight there, we were forever."

## cindy lou who - Sabrina Carpenter

> "Breaking my heart, 'tis the season I guess."

## Remember - Sam Ock

> "When stars were fallen / WHen I felt broken / I will remember / You felt the same"

## Morning in the Aves - The Backseat Lovers

> "What if you found your voice? / What if you had a choice? / Would you tell me off?"
